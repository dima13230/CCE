# Colors Concentration Exercise - CCE

Made with Godot Engine v4.2.1

# Disclaimer

This work has been inspired by and based on Tom J. Chalko's insights about aura
which can be discovered [here](https://thiaoouba.com/aura_eye_exercise.htm).

To learn the basics as well as theoretical background of this exercise
we recommend to study aforementioned insights.

This exercise is organized into separate difficulty levels, 
choosing each difficulty requires the user to have gained prior degrees of mastery in the more simple exercises.
The more advanced levels offer more simulataneous degrees of exposure and stimulation of vision
 with more colors as well as the synchronization of both parts of the brain.

Should the user experience any kind of any degree of discomfort at any point during the exercise, 
we recommend the user to stop immediately and rest.
Common precautions of using display devices are advised.

Our approximation to monochromatic colors found in the full spectrum of visible light is limited by the technological
constraints of current display devices.
